# Apollo Architecture

This document explains the architecture of the Apollo compiler and how it transforms Racket code into Luau.

## Overview

Apollo is a source-to-source compiler that takes Racket code as input and produces equivalent Luau code as output. The compilation process involves several stages:

1. Parsing
2. Analysis
3. Transformation
4. Code Generation

## Compilation Pipeline

### 1. Parsing Stage

The parsing stage converts Racket source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

```racket
;; Input Racket code
(define (add x y)
  (+ x y))

;; Parsed AST
'(define
  (add x y)
  (+ x y))
```

### 2. Analysis Stage

The analysis stage performs several tasks:
- Type inference
- Symbol resolution
- Scope analysis
- Dependency tracking

This stage ensures that the code is semantically valid and gathers information needed for transformation.

### 3. Transformation Stage

The transformation stage converts Racket constructs into their Luau equivalents:

```racket
;; Racket
(define (add x y)
  (+ x y))

;; Transformed to intermediate representation
'(function-definition
  'add
  '(x y)
  '(+ x y))
```

### 4. Code Generation Stage

The final stage generates Luau code from the transformed AST:

```lua
-- Generated Luau code
local function add(x, y)
    return x + y
end
```

## Key Components

### Parser

The parser is responsible for:
- Lexical analysis (tokenization)
- Syntax analysis (AST construction)
- Error reporting for syntax errors

### Analyzer

The analyzer performs:
- Semantic analysis
- Type checking
- Symbol table management
- Scope resolution

### Transformer

The transformer handles:
- Pattern matching for Racket constructs
- AST transformation rules
- Special form handling
- Macro expansion

### Code Generator

The code generator:
- Traverses the transformed AST
- Generates Luau syntax
- Handles indentation and formatting
- Manages variable naming

## Special Features

### 1. Roblox Integration

Apollo includes special handling for Roblox-specific features:
- Instance creation and manipulation
- Event handling
- Service access
- Property access

### 2. Error Handling

The compiler includes comprehensive error handling:
- Syntax error reporting
- Type error detection
- Runtime error prevention
- Helpful error messages

### 3. Optimization

Several optimizations are performed:
- Constant folding
- Dead code elimination
- Inline expansion
- Loop optimization

## Extension Points

Apollo is designed to be extensible:

### 1. Custom Transformers

You can add custom transformers for:
- Domain-specific language features
- Custom syntax sugar
- Special optimization rules

### 2. Plugin System

The plugin system allows:
- Adding new analysis passes
- Extending the type system
- Adding new code generation targets

## Best Practices

When working with Apollo:

1. **Code Organization**
   - Keep related functions together
   - Use meaningful names
   - Add type annotations where helpful

2. **Performance**
   - Avoid unnecessary allocations
   - Use appropriate data structures
   - Consider compilation time

3. **Maintainability**
   - Document complex transformations
   - Add tests for edge cases
   - Keep the codebase modular

## Future Directions

Planned improvements include:
- More sophisticated type inference
- Better error messages
- Additional optimization passes
- Support for more Racket features
