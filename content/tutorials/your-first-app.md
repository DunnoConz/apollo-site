# Tutorial: Your First Apollo Application

This tutorial guides you through creating, compiling, and running a very basic Roblox script using Racket and the Apollo compiler.

**Goal:** Create a Racket script that prints a message and defines a simple function, compile it to Luau, and run it in Roblox Studio.

**Time:** 15-20 minutes

**Prerequisites:**

*   Apollo compiler installed (see [Getting Started](/getting-started)).
*   Roblox Studio installed.
*   Basic familiarity with Racket syntax.
*   Basic familiarity with Roblox Studio.

## Step 1: Create Your Project Directory

First, create a directory for your new Apollo-based Roblox project.

```bash
mkdir my-apollo-game
cd my-apollo-game
```

## Step 2: Write Your Racket Code

Create a file named `main.rkt` inside your project directory. This will be the entry point for our simple script.

Open `main.rkt` in your text editor and add the following Racket code:

```racket
#lang racket/base

(provide setup-game) ; Export the setup-game function

;; Simple function to demonstrate Racket logic
(define (add a b)
  (+ a b))

;; Main function to set up the game environment (in a real game)
(define (setup-game)
  (displayln "Initializing game via Apollo...")
  (let ([result (add 5 3)])
    (displayln (string-append "Calculation result: " (number->string result))))
  (displayln "Game setup complete."))

;; Call setup-game when the script starts
(setup-game)
```

**Explanation:**

*   `#lang racket/base`: Specifies the base Racket language.
*   `(provide setup-game)`: Makes the `setup-game` function available if this file were required as a module by another Racket file (though not strictly necessary for this simple script).
*   `(define (add a b) ...)`: Defines a simple function `add`.
*   `(define (setup-game) ...)`: Defines the main logic block for our script.
*   `(displayln ...)`: Prints messages to the output.
*   `(setup-game)`: Calls the main function immediately when the script is executed.

## Step 3: Compile Racket to Luau

Now, use the Apollo compiler to translate `main.rkt` into Luau code. Navigate back to your project directory in the terminal (if you aren't already there) and run:

```bash
raco apollo main.rkt -o main.luau
```

*   `raco apollo`: Invokes the Apollo compiler (assuming this is the command).
*   `main.rkt`: Specifies the input Racket file.
*   `-o main.luau`: Specifies the output Luau file name.

If the compilation is successful, you will now have a `main.luau` file in your project directory.

## Step 4: Inspect the Luau Code (Optional)

Open `main.luau` in your text editor. You'll see the Luau code generated by Apollo. It should functionally correspond to the Racket code you wrote, likely involving Luau functions and `print` statements corresponding to `displayln`.

## Step 5: Run in Roblox Studio

1.  **Open Roblox Studio** and create a new Baseplate or open an existing project.
2.  In the Explorer panel, navigate to `ServerScriptService`.
3.  Right-click `ServerScriptService` and select `Insert Object` -> `Script`.
4.  Rename the newly created `Script` to something descriptive, like `ApolloMain`.
5.  Double-click the `ApolloMain` script to open it in the script editor.
6.  Delete the default `print("Hello world!")` line.
7.  Go back to your text editor, select all the content in `main.luau`, and copy it.
8.  Paste the copied Luau code into the `ApolloMain` script editor in Roblox Studio.
9.  Click the **Play** button (or File -> Play) to start the game simulation.

## Step 6: Check the Output

While the game is running, open the **Output** window in Roblox Studio (View -> Output).
You should see the messages printed by your script:

```
Initializing game via Apollo...
Calculation result: 8
Game setup complete.
```

## Congratulations!

You have successfully created a simple Racket script, compiled it to Luau using Apollo, and executed it within Roblox Studio!

This tutorial covered the basics. You can now explore more complex Racket features, learn how to interact with Roblox APIs, and structure larger projects using Apollo.
